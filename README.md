## 🛠️ Tech Used

- **Flutter** (UI framework)
- **Dart** (language)
- [Google Fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) for custom font styles
- Static asset/network images for food items and banners

---

## 🏗️ Features Implemented

- **Top AppBar:** Delivery info & avatar
- **Search Bar:** With mic icon and “Veg Mode” toggle
- **Offer Banner:** Discount/offer section
- **Horizontal ListView:** For scrolling food cards
- **Food Cards:** Image, title, ratings, delivery time, description, price, “Add” button
- **Bottom “View Cart” Bar**
- **Responsive UI:** Used MediaQuery for adaptive layouts
- **Clean Modular Code:** All major widgets separated for maintainability

---

## 💬 My Approach

- **UI Fidelity:** Matched the Blinkit screen closely (spacing, color, font, layout)
- **Simplicity:** Used only setState for state; no complex state management
- **Static Data:** All food items and banners use static or hardcoded data for review
- **Modularity:** Separated widgets (`FoodCard`, `OfferBanner`, `SearchBar`) for clarity
- **Responsiveness:** Ensured the layout adapts to various screen sizes
